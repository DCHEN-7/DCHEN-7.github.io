						<h4><u>Objects of Interest: Market Share, Gas Usage, Average Price, and Purchasing Power <br />from the perspective of an interested roofing company</u> <br /> </h4>
					Here is the inital .csv, but where do we begin? <br />
					<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/rawdata.PNG" alt="" /></a></small>

					<p>Well, roofing companies want lots of space. So a good start is to clean and analyze our data for larger vehicles.
					That being said how do we define larger vehicles? We have total of 31 unique body types. Since the number of unique body types is relatively small,
				  we can manually research. We define this set as the <em>larger vehicles</em>. </p>
				  <a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/LargerVehiclesSet.PNG" alt="" /></a>
				  <hr>
				<p>Since we want to focus only on these defined larger vehicles, let's create a subset of the inital data with which
					we can then clean and begin to analyze... <br />
					<p>
					 1. <em>CTRL F</em> and <em>CTRL -</em> to delete all the rows which hold body types
					 that aren't part of our larger vehicles set.<br />
						2. Remove the columns of "Passengers" and "Doors" since they aren't very relevant to our interests. <br />
						3. Remove any rows with <em>NULL</em> "Kilometers" or "Price" since they are crucial pieces of information.<br />
						4. Gas and Gasoline are the same thing; <em>CTRL H</em> to replace all the "Gasoline" with "Gas" <br />
						5. Removed duplicates within the remaining columns <br />
						6. Removed blank spaces through TRIM() <br />
						7. Used Find & Replace, SUBSTIUTE(), and "Text to Columns" to convert the columns representing gas usage in the city and on the highway into
						a single digit numerical data type with which we can analyze (the previous format was not analytics friendly)

					<p>With the subset data somewhat cleaned, we then some pivot charts to gain some insights:<br />

						<hr>

						<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/PercentageShare.PNG" alt="" /></a>
						<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/CountListings.PNG" alt="" /></a>

						<div class = "box">
						<p> Right away, we see that there are two leading body types which dominate the market: "Truck" and "Crew Cab"
							with a staggering 52.13% and 34.84%, respectively. Another way to see this disparity, group together all the larger vehicles outside of
							 the top 2 and they together only make up 13.03% of the listings.</p>

					<p>
							Furthermore, even if we strip away percentages from the question, we see that "Truck" stands at the top with exactly 956 listings,
							 still relatively far ahead of "Crew Cabs" following behind with 639;
							yet the third highest body type, "Regular Cab", is practically a rare sighting with a listing total of 67.
					</p>

					<p>It is worth noting that not only does this analysis give us valuable insight into the current market of what we consider
						used larger vehicles, but also that any body type class not named "Truck" or "Crew Cab" is not worth analyzing independently in this case study simply due to
						the low number of data regarding them.
					</div>

					<p>Since we cleaned up the formatting regarding the gas usage columns, we could now begin to analyze them. At inital glance,
					all the data values in the <em>highway</em> column appeared to be relatively close in value, in particular with the body type <em>trucks</em>. We decided
					 to explore the validity of this speculation by building a normal distribution graph.
					 </p>

					 <p>
						After calculating the mean, standard deviation, as well as normal deviation of all 550 data points, we plot all of our resulting values.
						Furthermore, we then write the following query within MySQL to return the percentage of trucks whose gas usage is within one standard 
						deviation of the mean.

						<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/SDQuery.PNG" alt="" /></a>

					 </p>
					 
					 Again, the following analysis would not be possible with
					the inital format of the <em>City</em> and <em>Highway</em> columns.

					<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/GasUsageHighway.PNG" alt="" /></a>

					<div class = "box">
					The mean of gas consumption per 100km within the body type of <em>trucks</em> is approximately 10.89L with an approximate standard deviation of 1.16L.
					Furthermore, within one standard deviation of our mean, we see that 84.6% actually fall within this interval. Meaning, the inital speculation that
					various gas consumptions on the highway were "relatively close in value" indeed possessed some real merit. 

					</div>

					<p> Lastly, we consider our budget of $60,000 and build a visualization through Excel & SQL to represent our purchasing power in the current market. 
						Recall that we have a relatively low count of body types aside from <em> Crew Cabs </em> and <em>Trucks</em>, meaning every 
						reported percentage after not named <em>Crew Cab</em> or <em>Truck</em> should be taken with a large grain of salt.

						<p>
							We use the following query to calculate the percentages of vehicles by body type we can purchase with $60,000: 
							<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/PercentQuery.PNG" alt="" /></a>
						</p>

						<p>And then graph all of our resulting percentages along the mean price, again grouped by body type:</p>

						<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/AveragePrice_PurchasingPower.PNG" alt="" /></a>
						<ul class="actions special">

						<div class = "box">
							<p> Immeditately, we see that the average price of Crew Cab's far exceed the rest of the body types. Most notably, they exceed Truck's
								 average price of $54,121.41 by nearly $15,000. Furthermore, through this visualization we gain the insight that with our current
								budget of $60,000, we can only consider a small portion of the Crew Cabs, specifically 22.6% of the total listings. Meanwhile for Trucks,
								our purchasing power looks stronger with us having the budget to consider 55.1% of the total truck listings. With the remaining body types
								of low count value, really the only thing we can say is that our budget seems to cover the majority of the rare listings
								 of vehicles not named <em>Crew Cab</em>
								 or <em>Truck</em>.</p>
